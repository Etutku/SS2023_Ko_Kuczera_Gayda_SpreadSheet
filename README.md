## Project Description 
* Facial Detection and Facial Recognition are computer technologies used to detect human faces in a digital image or video and identify or confirm a person's identity using 
their face respectively. Today, these technologies are widely used. Such as face unlock used on smartphones and face detection in temperature scanner which was widespread 
during the Covid-19 pandemic.
* Using facial recognition technology, we decided to create a web application for the attendance system that can be used by educational Institutions, offices, organizations 
or any place that requires security.
  - Efficient and time-saving compared to the traditional method that calls names one by one.
  - The system identifies faces in live video input from a camera.
  - The algorithm will construct a boundary for each face candidate.
  - The system will compare faces with the provided database.
  - If the face doesn’t match with anyone from the database the system will label it as unknown.
  - Since the live input of one’s face must match with the saved data, calling another person’s name for roll call (faking attendance) is impossible.

## Technological Stack 
* Project Description 
* OpenCV, which is a popular computer vision library in Python.
* Firebase Real Time Database, which is a NoSQL cloud database.
